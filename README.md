# Project---Assembler
An assembler is a program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.
This project simulates the working of a simulator.
The CUI software accepts a set of instructions, checks them for validity against a list of predefined instructions and generates the corresponding object code.
